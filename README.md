# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

## Overview

The Black-Scholes Model is a mathematical model used for pricing European-style options. This project implements the Black-Scholes formula along with Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing, providing a web interface using Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.

## Features

- Calculate option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Monte Carlo simulation for estimating option prices.
- Graphical representation of option prices and Greeks.
- Sensitivity analysis for various input parameters.
- Interactive web application built with Streamlit.
